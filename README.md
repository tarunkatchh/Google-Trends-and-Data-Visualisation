# Google-Trends-and-Data-Visualisation
Google Trends gives us an estimate of search volume. Let's explore if search popularity relates to other kinds of data.

## Learning Points & Summary
In this project I learned how to:

- How to use `.describe()` to quickly see some descriptive statistics at a glance.

- How to use `.resample()` to make a time-series data comparable to another by changing the periodicity.

- How to work with matplotlib.dates Locators to better style a timeline (e.g., an axis on a chart).

- How to find the number of `NaN` values with `.isna().values.sum()`

- How to change the resolution of a chart using the figure's dpi

- How to create dashed `'--'` and dotted `'-.'` lines using linestyles

- How to use different kinds of markers (e.g., 'o' or '^') on charts.

- Fine-tuning the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linewidth and colours (both in the form of named colours and HEX codes).

- Using `.grid()` to help visually identify seasonality in a time series.


I think working with Pandas is starting to feel more and more second nature at this point.


You can download the completed code for this repository I've attached the completed notebook to this repo as a link. If you have any issues, upload it to google drive and open it as a Google Colab Notebook.
